# SVM Suite instructions

Name *SVM Suite* stands for Service Virtual Machine Suite, and it represents a programming framework intended for automated reasoning and human-computer interaction. *SVM Suite* includes a set of service virtual machines (SVM) built on principles of service oriented programming ([SOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_programming)) paradigm. SOP paradigm clearly distincts between services that perform given tasks. Such services communicate between each other by passing messages. Benefits of this approach to programming is high modularity needed for code reuse, high agility in process of code development, and granular independence between services that can be invoked parallelly in a multitasking environment.

Some examples that may be represented as services are RAM, permanent storage, screen, keyboard and mouse. Other, more abstract examples may embed higher or lower level computing platforms. By composing these kinds of services together, depending on what the services are, we may build a whole system in the role of programming library, computer application, operating system, or maybe even enthusiastic self-controlling hardware system driven by artificial intelligence empowered form of existential being.

Minimal viable product of *SVM Suite* includes four services called virtual service machines, namely: *router.svm*, *console.svm*, *compute-stateful.svm*, and *compute-stateless.svm*. These virtual service machines should be just about enough to establish meaningful communication between human and computer, guided by your software inspiration.

> *Note that all the code and exchanged data in SVM Suite services is written in [s-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) form borrowed from [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) family of programming languages. Ingenious s-expression form is chosen because it has very convenient properties relating to code related tasks.*
